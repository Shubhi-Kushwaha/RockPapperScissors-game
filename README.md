ROCK PAPER SCISSOR GAME :
Creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to practice web development skills. Here's a summary of how such a project might be structured:

HTML: Structure

 Basic Layout:

  * The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game.

  * You'll have buttons for the player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * A section to display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.

  * You may also include a reset button to play again.

CSS: Styling

 Styling the Game:

  * CSS is used to style the buttons, the display area, and the overall layout to make it visually appealing.

  * You can add hover effects, animations, and transitions to make the game more interactive.

  * You might use flexbox or grid for layout management to keep the design responsive across different devices.

JavaScript: Game Logic

 Game Logic Implementation:

  * JavaScript handles the core functionality of the game.

  * When the player selects an option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), an event listener triggers the game logic.

  * The computer randomly selects its choice.

  * The script compares the player's choice with the computer's and determines the winner based on the rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock).

  * The result is then displayed to the player.

Additional Features:

  * You might include a scoring system to keep track of how many rounds the player has won.

  * You can add sounds or animations when a player wins or loses to enhance user experience.

This project showcases my ability to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and interactive web application.
